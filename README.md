# Search-engine
Search engine using `trie` and `KMP` algorithms for unimodal text searches.

# Trie

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of key-value pairs is used for storing the data for retrival. 

# Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm

KMP algorithm is an efficent method for comparing strings with substrings.
